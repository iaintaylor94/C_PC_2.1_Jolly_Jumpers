## Problem 2.1: Jolly Jumpers[^1]

### Problem description
This program is to determine whether a sequence (length n) of numbers is "Jolly" or not. A sequence is "Jolly" if the absolute value of the differences between sequential numbers take all values (1 - n-1). The first line states the length of the sequence, the next n integers is the sequence to compute. The program will print "Jolly" if the sequence is jolly and "Not jolly" if the sequence is not jolly.


### Example 
> **Input**
>4 1 4 2 3
>5 1 4 2 -1 6         

>**Output**
>Not jolly
